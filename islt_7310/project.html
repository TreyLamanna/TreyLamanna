        <h1>Computer Modeling and Blender:</h1>
        <p>Last spring I worked on a project for a computer modeling class of mine. This project was a 30 second animation that had an entire world created for it. For my project I had a cave that had many modeled statues in it. The character would walk through this cave showcasing all the whole environment I built. The theme for me was magic/fantasy. I wanted to use the lighting and coloring to give a mythical feel to the cave. The candles and colors contrast well to give the environment the life I wanted. I really enjoyed the way this project ended up and is one of my favorite I have done so far in college.</p>

        <h1>Rock Paper Scissor C# program</h1>
        <p>I had a coding class where I had to create a rock paper scissor game. This game would have the user pick either rock, paper, or scissor. The computer would then pick randomly and tell the user whether they won or not. There was also a leaderboard. The game would ask for the players name. This would allow them to be a part of the leaderboard system. There was an option to see the top scores. Along with seeing the all time highest scores, you were also able to see your own statistics even if they were not so good. </p>

        <h1>Game Design Project</h1>
        <p>I was part of a game development project where I created the concept of my own game. I used my understanding of game design to create this project. This game is a superhero platformer/fighter. The game consists of five playable superheroes that all have unique abilities. This group of five heroes includes Heater (fire powers), Avalanche (ice powers), Brainstorm (telekinesis), Multiplier (cloning), and Agent Jones (soldier/gadget character). The player will be able to switch out which character they are in the level. Each of the characters has certain abilities that allow them to accomplish things that the other four characters cannot.</p>
