                My two years in college have felt very quick so far. It seems like my mind is always onto the next thing. We live in a world where it always about what’s next instead of reflecting in what’s happened. I am glad that I am currently writing this because it has allowed me to look back at all the work I have accomplish. I never really appreciated all the work I have put in because I’m always thinking about the work I have yet to put in.

            <p class = "first-bold">My first project was a Blender project. This project had computer modeling and animation. This project really helped become more well-rounded in my computer skills. Learning a new software such as Blender is always going to help me be the best I can be. I was able to use my own creativity in the projects. The creativity was my favorite part of this project. I like to create things that are distinctly mine. This project allowed me to combine my creativity and knowledge into a really cool creation.</p>

            <p class = "first-bold">My second project was a rock paper scissor game. This game would have the user pick either rock, paper, or scissor. The computer would then pick randomly and tell the user whether they won or not. There was also a leaderboard. This project really helped me use my C# and coding skills into a real project. I was able to use many of the concepts we learned the entire semester and actually have something to show for it. The leaderboard system was the most important in my opinion. This allowed me to use sata storage and revival. This is a very important skill in the programming world and it was nice to be able to practice with relevant concepts.</p>

            <p class = "first-bold">I was part of a game development project where I created the concept of my own game. I used my understanding of game design to create this project. This game is a superhero platformer/fighter. This project allowed me to use my understanding of game theory. I was able to cater my game to the player as all games should. You must have a game be challenging while also easy understand. Game theory is really all about what the player feels. I felt like this project helped me look at things from the perspective of the customer rather than the creator. This project and class is also where more of my knowledge of video games comes in handy. This class really helped me further my love for gaming. I know want to be able to share that love in this website.
