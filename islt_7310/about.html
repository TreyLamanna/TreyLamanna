        <h3>I am from Memphis, Tennessee</h3>
        My name is Trey Lamanna. I am a 20 year old college student. I am pursuing a bacehlors degree in Information Technology from the University of Missouri. I am currently a junior at university. I am on course to graduate with all honor roll in the spring of 2025.I have not narrowed down an specification yet, but I am very interested in cyber security. I took a class on it in high school and have chosen many of the cyber security electives that Mizzou has to offer. Computers and technology have always been very interesting to me. A favorite quote of mine is <blockquote>“There are no shortcuts to places worth going”.</blockquote> I am firm believer in hard work being the deciding factor in any success story. No matter how much talent or skills one might have hard work will beat that everytime.
