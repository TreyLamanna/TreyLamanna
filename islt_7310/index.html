            <p>Welcome to “Play Now or Later”. This is a video game directory website to help find you the game you have been looking for. Gaming is an ever-growing industry. One major problem in that industry is people getting burnt out on the games they play. This website will allow players to find that new game they have been craving. The games do not always have to be new. There will be different pages for each major category in gaming. Using charts from the PlayStation Store and Steam we will be able to find the most popular games from each genre. Then we will be able to showcase these games to the players looking for their next game. I want there to be trailers, reviews, and much more information on each game. Video games have big been a big part fo my life for as long as I can remember. I want to create this website so I can bring the joy of gaming to others.
